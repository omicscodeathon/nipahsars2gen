Comparative Genomic Analysis of Nipah Virus and SARS-CoV-2 using Bioinformatics

## Introduction

The ongoing study of viral genomes is crucial for understanding the genetic mechanisms that underlie virus behavior, transmission, and pathogenicity. In this project, we focus on comparing the genomic sequences of two significant viruses: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and the Nipah virus. Both viruses pose substantial public health threats, but they belong to different viral families and exhibit distinct characteristics and modes of transmission.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is a novel coronavirus identified in late 2019. It has rapidly spread worldwide, causing widespread morbidity and mortality. Understanding its genetic structure helps in tracking mutations, understanding transmission patterns, and developing effective treatments and vaccines.

The Nipah virus, on the other hand, is a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe respiratory and neurological diseases in humans. First identified in 1998 in Malaysia, Nipah virus outbreaks have been sporadic but deadly, with high fatality rates. The virus is transmitted from animals to humans, primarily through bats, and human-to-human transmission is also possible.

## Objective
This project aims to employ deep learning techniques to analyze and compare the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and Nipah virus. By leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence data, we can capture the sequential patterns and features inherent in the viral genomes. The ultimate goal is to train a model that can distinguish between the two viruses based on their genetic sequences.

## The steps involved in this project include:
1. *Data Loading*: Reading and parsing the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and Nipah virus from provided files.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Encoding the sequences into a numerical format suitable for machine learning, and padding them to a consistent length.
3. *Model Building and Training*: Constructing an LSTM model to learn the patterns in the genetic sequences, training it on labeled data to classify the sequences.
4. *Evaluation*: Using a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance and understand its accuracy in distinguishing between the two viruses.

By following these steps, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in genomic analysis and contribute to the broader understanding of these two critical pathogens.
